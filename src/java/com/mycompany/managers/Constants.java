    /* =========== Our Design Decision ===========
        We decided to use directories external to our application
        for the storage and retrieval of user and project files.

        We do not want to use a database for the following reasons:
            (a) Database storage and retrieval of large files as
                BLOB (binary large object) degrades performance.
            (b) BLOBs increase the database complexity.

        Therefore, we use the following three external directories
        for the storage and retrieval of user and project files.

Identifies the application path that serves as the base URI for all resource
URIs provided by Path. We can't use the '/' path because that's already
reserved for serving our actual web pages, so we must define a sub-path for
web services. Basically, this means that all JAX-RS web services that our
application exposes will be accessible at addressed of the form:

  http://base_url/webresources/endpoint_address

JAX-RS is nice to use in the Java EE environment because it requires no
particular configuration and provides a simple annotation-based interface to
deploy web services with.

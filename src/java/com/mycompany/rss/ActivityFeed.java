JAX-RS provides a number of potentially-useful annotations for mapping POJOs
which represent resource classes to web services. These annotations include:

  @Path - defines the path (relative to @ApplicationPath) of this web service
  @GET - specifies the resource can be accessed using a HTTP GET request
  @PUT - specifies the resource can be accessed using a HTTP PUT request
  @POST - specifies the resource can be accessed using a HTTP POST request
  @DELETE - specifies the resource can be accessed using a HTTP DELETE request
  @HEAD - specifies the resource can be accessed using a HTTP HEAD request
  @Produces - specifies which Internet media types the response may come in
  @Consumes - specifies which Internet media types the request may use

In this case, we're using the @Path annotation because we want the ActivityFeed
resource class to be mapped to a web service at the address:

  http://base_url/webresources/rss

By default, this resource class has a per-request lifecycle, so it's created and
destroyed each time a request to its web service endpoint is made.
